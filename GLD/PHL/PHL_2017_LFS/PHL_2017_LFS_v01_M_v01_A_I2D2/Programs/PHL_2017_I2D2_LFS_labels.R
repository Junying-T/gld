# PHL_2017_I2D2_LFS_labels.R
# A helper script for PHL_2017_I2D2_LFS_labels.do that harmonizes data labels

# Note, this script assumes that you have already run PHL_2017_I2D2_LFS_labels.do and output an iecodebook xlsx file 
# and duplicated it manually and saved it under the suffix "-IN.xlsx". For more info, see README
