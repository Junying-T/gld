# Education and Labor Modules Ages

A brief overview of the minimum applicable ages for the Education and Labor modules in each survey year.

## Terminology

Typically, each Labor Force Survey or equivalent will only ask education or labor-related sets of questions to relevant age groups, which are defined differently across time and place. Only if the respondent is of the minimum age or higher will the enumerator ask these education- or labor-related questions. Sometimes a maximum age limit exists as well.
