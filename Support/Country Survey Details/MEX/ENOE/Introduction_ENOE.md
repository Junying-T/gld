# Mexican National labour force survey (ENOE) specifications

The ENOE published five versions of their questionnaire. Within a year, the NSO changes the type of survey they use by quarter. Due to the difference in the length and questions from each version, the team chose the first quarter of each year to avoid seasonality and discrepancies between the years. The team found that the quarter one only varies in year 2007 and 2008, however the questionnaire version change did not alter significantly the questions relevant to the labor force harmonization process.  

## Type of survey questionnaires

The INEGI started using ENOE since 2005. Up to 2020, INEGI introduced  five revisions to their base questionnaire developed in 2005.   

Table 1. ENOE version per year

| :------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| 2005 to 2006  | First Extended Version            |
| 2007          | First Short Version               |
| 2008          | Second Short Version              | 
| 2009          | Second Extended Version           | 
| 2010 to 2012  | Third Extended Version            | 
| 2013 to 2015  | Fourth Extended Version           | 
| 2016 to 2020  | Fifth Extended Version            | 

After conducting a mapping of the survey questionnaires in the different versions the team found that on average the differences between the extended and the short version of the questionnaires are the following:
